# CricketWorldCupInsights
## Project Description:
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for the "Cricket World Cup Dataset Analysis" project. The project focuses on leveraging Power BI to analyze Cricket World Cup data from 2013 to 2019.

In this analysis, we explore various aspects of the Cricket World Cup, including batting, bowling, fielding, and overall team performance. The dataset is imported into Power BI and undergoes data cleaning and shaping to ensure its readiness for analysis.

Using Power BI's powerful visualization tools, we create interactive dashboards that provide insights into the performance of different teams and players over the years. The visualizations and charts help identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to team success.

The project aims to provide valuable insights to cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and stakeholders in the cricketing world. It serves as a resource for understanding the dynamics of the Cricket World Cup and making data-informed decisions for future tournaments.
